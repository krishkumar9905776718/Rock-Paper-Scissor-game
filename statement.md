Rock–Paper–Scissor Game 

1. Problem Statement

The game of Rock–Paper–Scissor has been implemented so that user input can be taken and compared with a computer-generated choice.A simple system was required where choices could be processed, winners could be decided, and the final match result could be displayed. An interactive experience was also expected through features like countdown animations and screen clearing.

2. Scope of the Project

The project has been limited to creating a commandline Rock Paper Scissor game in python. Only basic gameplay functions have been included. User inputs are taken, computer choices are generated randomly, and the winner of each round is decided automatically. The score is updated after every round and a final result is shown at the end.

3. Target Users

This project is mainly intended for users who want to learn the basics of Python programming. It is also suitable for students who need simple game programs for academic submissions. The game can be played by anyone who wants a lightweight and offline terminal-based Rock–Paper–Scissor experience.


4. High-Level Features

A clean and easy command-line interface is provided for user interaction.
computer moves are generated using the random module.
a short countdown animation is shown before revealing the choices.
invalid inputs are handled by repeatedly asking the user to enter a correct choice.
A round-wise scoring  system is maintained automatically.
